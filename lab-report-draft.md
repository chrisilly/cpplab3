# Feedback

First of all, when you hand these assignments out next year, please for the love of god do not hand out files or example code with `Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶` because it doesn't load rightâ€”and even if it does, it is absolutely horrendous. This pisses me off ðŸ˜© (In my case, I had to replace every instance of `Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶` in the `PersonExempel.txt` because they all showed up as the `ï¿½` replacement character. *Might* have to do with my using **VS Code** as opposed to **VS22**.)

Alsoâ€”considering the nature of `c++`â€”it would make so much sense if we were always given header files to accompany the list of requirements. This is a practical way of outlining the requirements and expected structure and implementation of the programs.

# Assignment 1

I don't know why my header files don't recognize `string` even though I have `using namespace std` :( Update: `#include <iostream>` (or `#include <string>`) fixed itâ€”which is a bit weird though because I hadn't needed it in my other assignment.
